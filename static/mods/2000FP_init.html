For the first time since Grover Cleveland, there will be a president that serves two non-consecutive terms. Who will it be? Will it be Jimmy Carter, the 39th President who served from 1977 to 1981? Or will it be George H.W. Bush, the 41st President who served from 1989 to 1993? <p>The main issues of the race will be the budget surplus, education, and some tension occurring in the Middle East. Both candidates will have to use these issues to their advantages, and convince the public that while they may have been rejected for a second term previously, they are up to return to the job in 2000.</p>",
